# Stroke-Disease-Prediction
A strokeÂ is a medical condition in which the blood arteries in the brain rupture, leading brain damage. Symptoms may appear if the brain's flow of blood and other nutrients is disrupted. Stroke is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Early awareness of the numerous stroke warning symptoms can assist to lessen the severity of the stroke. To forecast the chance of a stroke happening in the brain, many machine learning (ML) models have been created. Random forest, support vector machines, decision trees and classifiers, and neural networks were the most often utilised approaches.
